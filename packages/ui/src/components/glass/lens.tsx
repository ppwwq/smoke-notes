/**
 * The liqui lens kernel — refraction for a single small control.
 *
 * This is not `@liqui-design/glass`, and it is not trying to be. That package
 * is a *surface*: one shared displacement map and one shared filter, sized for
 * panels and popovers, tuned so a drawer and a scrollbar thumb can both live
 * off the same dials. A switch thumb and a slider thumb cannot. They need
 * their own profile, refraction that moves under your finger, and a specular
 * that carries colour rather than white — none of which a shared surface
 * should be made to grow.
 *
 * So this file is the part those controls genuinely have in common: solving a
 * glass profile, painting it into a pair of maps, the filter chain that reads
 * them, and a spring integrator to drive it. Everything that makes a switch
 * look like a switch and a slider look like a slider stays in those files —
 * the surface, the geometry, and every number.
 *
 * Chromium only, like all refraction on the web: `backdrop-filter: url(#…)` is
 * unimplemented elsewhere. Call `supportsRefraction()` and fall back.
